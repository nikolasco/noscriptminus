+ URI Validator facility for on-demand protection against URI-based

  site and landing on a trusted (scripting allowed) site:
  1. GET requests with a query string get all the matches for the
     noscript.filterXGetRx regular expression replaced with space
  2. POST requests are turned into no-data GET
  3. Every request filtering action is logged to the Console, while a
