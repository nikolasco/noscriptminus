NoScript ChangeLog

TODO:
Allow some URL only for current session life-span (many requests!!!)
Turn javascript: links into regular links where JS is disabled (zasxae)

v 1.0.9
=====================================================================
+ Temporarily allow URLs (for current session only): temporary items
  are shown in italics font
+ Clean uninstall in Deer Park
+ Added jar: to the default white-list, to allow about:plugin
  and other "special" URLs to work out-of-the-box
x Better work-arounds for Firefox synchronization bugs
x Fixed conflict when a "View Source" window was open

v 1.0.8
=====================================================================
+ Whole addresses are shown when a port number is specified, no
  matter which the Appearance options are, since enabling a domain
  doesn't enable it for non-standard ports (thanks to jayvdb for
  suggestion)
+ Stop every browser activity before changing policies (this should
  be a workaround for most crashes dued to Firefox CAPS bugs)

v 1.0.7
=====================================================================
+ Notification message "popup blocker" style (Firefox only)
+ Autoreload synchronizes every view whose permissions have changed
+ Spanish translation (thanks to Alberto Mart√≠nez)
x Improved subframes management in the contextual menu
x Better UI support for "special" TLDS like co.uk, co.nz and others
x Improved support for numeric addresses
x Audio feedback with more discreet sound effect :-)

v 1.0.6
=====================================================================
+ Whitelist import/export (thanks hsmwrv for suggestion)
+ Only 2nd level (base) domains shown by default in the "Allow" menu 
  items (easier operation for non-geeks; geeks can still revert to
  the old fine grained interface using the "Appearance" options)
+ Blocked scripts audio feedback (thanks to Markus for suggestion)
+ about:config/noscript.permanent can be changed live (no FF restart)
x chrome content URL are properly whitelisted (XUL error pages OK)
x Fixed empty permanent list problem (thanks to Patrick and Oremina 
  for report)

v 1.0.5
=====================================================================
+ "Appearance" option to hide/show popup menu and status bar icon; if
  you decide to hide both, options are still reachable through the 
  Extension Manager context menu (thanks Dick Minor for suggestion)
+ 2nd level domain trick don't clutters Options Dialog anymore
  (http[s]:// auto-prefixed domains are hidden in whitelist)
x Fixed menu layout (thanks to TheOneKEA for report)

v 1.0.4
=====================================================================
+ Automatically creates http:// and https:// prefixed URLs when a 2nd
  level domain (xyz.com) is allowed, as a workaround for Firefox not 
  matching URLs with a raw 2nd level domain if no protocol is listed
  (thanks to Laura for report)
+ "Allowed" status feedback for chrome:// URLs (pacanukeha)
x Core functionality refactored in a XPCOM service

v 1.0.3
=====================================================================
+ Feedback about actual presence of script elements in current page
  (white "S" icons if no script tag is found, while number of found 
  tags is shown in the tooltip - thanks to Volker for suggestion)  
+ Feedback about partial permissions in pages containing subframes
  (a broken red "stop" sign means only some frames are forbidden)
+ Events are coalesced for better performance and stability
+ Improved options dialog usability (new items are ensured visible
  and "delete" key performs mouse-less site removal)
+ Added hotmail/msn/passport domains to default whitelist (thanks to
  Swann for suggestion)
+ Added googlesyndication.com and noscript.net to permanent list ;)
x Fixed whitelist options dialog sometimes "forgetting" recently 
  added items (thanks to TheOneKEA, Bill Mayer and Bill Selden for 
  their reports)

v 1.0.2
=====================================================================
+ Option dialog shortcuts (thanks to Ulysses for suggestion)
+ French translation (thanks to Xavier Robin)
x NoScript doesn't ignore port number in URLs anymore
x Moved "Options" and "About" items to the top of status bar menu
  (thanks to Filipp0s for suggestion and for the smaller icons too)
x Added mozillazine.org and gmail.google.com to default allow list
x No duplicates in menu when multiple frames share the same
  ancestor domain (e.g. mozillazine.org)

v 1.0.1
=====================================================================
+ Contextual menu for easy operation in statusbar-less windows
+ Current page is automatically reloaded when permissions are changed
+ Support for implicit subdomain inclusion (e.g. if you add 
  mozilla.org, you allow www.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org etc.)
+ German translation (thanks to my friend Thomas Weber)
x Fixed localization issue
x Work around for Firefox occasional crashes

v 1.0.0
