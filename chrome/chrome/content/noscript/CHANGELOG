v 1.1.4.6.070318
=====================================================================
+ First anti-XSS countermeasures round: "default deny" sanitization
  is applied to every request coming from an unknown (restricted) 
  site and landing on a trusted (scripting allowed) site:
  1. GET requests with a query string get all the matches for the
     noscript.filterXGetRx regular expression replaced with space
  2. POST requests are turned into no-data GET
  3. Every request filtering action is logged to the Console, while a
