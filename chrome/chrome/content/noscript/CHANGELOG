NoScript ChangeLog

TODO:
Allow some URL only for current session life-span

v 1.0.3
=====================================================================
+ Feedback about actual presence of script elements in current page
  (white "S" icons if no script tag is found, while number of found 
  tags is shown in the tooltip - thanks to Volker for suggestion)  
+ Feedback about partial permissions in pages containing subframes
  (a broken red "stop" sign means only some frames are forbidden)
+ Events are coalesced for better performance and stability
+ Improved options dialog usability (new items are ensured visible
  and "delete" key performs mouse-less site removal)
+ Added hotmail/msn/passport domains to default whitelist (thanks to
  Swann for suggestion)
+ Added googlesyndication.com and noscript.net to permanent list ;)
x Fixed whitelist options dialog sometimes "forgetting" recently 
  added items (thanks to TheOneKEA, Bill Mayer and Bill Selden for 
  their reports)

v 1.0.2
=====================================================================
+ Option dialog shortcuts (thanks to Ulysses for suggestion)
+ French translation (thanks to Xavier Robin)
x NoScript doesn't ignore port number in URLs anymore
x Moved "Options" and "About" items to the top of status bar menu
  (thanks to Filipp0s for suggestion and for the smaller icons too)
x Added mozillazine.org and gmail.google.com to default allow list
x No duplicates in menu when multiple frames share the same
  ancestor domain (e.g. mozillazine.org)

v 1.0.1
=====================================================================
+ Contextual menu for easy operation in statusbar-less windows
+ Current page is automatically reloaded when permissions are changed
+ Support for implicit subdomain inclusion (e.g. if you add 
  mozilla.org, you allow www.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org etc.)
+ German translation (thanks to my friend Thomas Weber)
x Fixed localization issue
x Work around for Firefox occasional crashes

v 1.0.0
=====================================================================
First public release
