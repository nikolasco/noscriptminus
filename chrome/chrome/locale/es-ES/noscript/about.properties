extensionDescription=Extra protection for your Firefox: \
NoScript allows JavaScript execution only for trusted domains \
of your choice (e.g. your home-banking web site). \
This whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking approach  prevents \
exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and even unknown!) \
with no loss of functionality... \
Experts will agree: Firefox is really safer with NoScript :-)
